Never try to change the state variable in the setter function.

for eg:-

const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
    
    function add() {
        setCount(count + 1)  this is fine but count++ is not fine cause it will change the state variable directly
    }

 Note: if you ever need the old value of state to help you determine the new value of state,you should pass a callback function to your state setter function instead of using state directly. This callback function will receive the old value of state as its parameter,which you can then use to determine your new value of state.

  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  function add() {
        setCount(count + 1)                 //this is not the best practice even though it works
    }


  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  function add() {
        setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)                // this is the best practice
    }
