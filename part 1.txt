ReactDOM.render()  : this renders stuff like html. it has 2 arguments, the first is what you want to render, the second is where you want to render it.

Eg; ReactDOM.render(
    <ul><li>Thing 1</li><li>Thing 2</li></ul>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);



Declarative style
ReactDOM.render(<h1 className="header">Hello, React!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"))
The same code when written in vanilla JS would be:

Impaerative style
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
const headingElement = document.createElement("h1");
headingElement.textContent = "Hello, React!";
headingElement.className = "header";
rootElement.appendChild(headingElement);

whenever you write jsx, an object is returned.


if you are using babel standalone from cdn for react you can easily deploy them on netlify or github pages. but if you are using create-react-app, you need to use netlify cli to deploy them on netlify.
