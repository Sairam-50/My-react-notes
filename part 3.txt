try to add your stylings in rem or relative units rather than abosolute units like px or pt.

 <h1>It is currently about {date.getHours() % 12} o'clock!</h1>
 In jsx anything in curly braces is evaluated as javascript. So you can use any javascript expression in there.

  const date = new Date()
    const hours = date.getHours() % 12
    
    return (
        <h1>It is currently about {hours} o'clock!</h1>
    )
Basically you can insert any js object in the braces
